"Bloxorz is a 3D block-rolling puzzle game where you control a rectangular block on a floating grid. You tilt the block to roll it across tiles, trying to stand it upright on a goal hole to clear each level. The block can fall off the edges or drop through weak tiles if it stands upright on them. Levels introduce switches that open or close bridges, teleporters that split the block into two halves you can move separately, and buttons that toggle tile states. The challenge is planning moves and rotations to navigate narrow paths and hit switches in the right order to reach the exit."
